Simple everything needed to build from scratch


## Step 1 Linux if you got no OS

## Step 2 Chromium if you got not edge or a other Chromium based browser

## Step 3 Chromium Build as Extension or PWA or Isolated Web App or Chrome App. 
The Chromium Build Tools are under /extensions/chromium/build
You can also deploy that url static to a https server it offers mainly a 
Build Task Optimized File Explorer Implementation something like Commander 
back in the days and a minimal fig shell implementation is available via

github.com/direktspeed/browser-shell

You can think about this like the File Tree Explorer in your Editor
With the Option to install Extensions.
